## What is this Repo ?
This repo consists of code dumps authored by me based on concepts of Kotlin.
## Why have these files been uploaded ?
After a while, every programmer tends to miss out on some fundamental concepts. They start running around notes and other resources to see basic functionality. To avoid a mess around me. I'm dumping these codes to refer to later.

## Can we use the code in this Repo ?
Yes, one can freely redistribute it provided it is used only for educational or community purpose. 
For commercial usage, people may contact me on telegram @vvreddy
